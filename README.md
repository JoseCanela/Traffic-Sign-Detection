# U.S. Traffic Sign Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks - YOLOv3
## Overview
* Developed an object detection model that identifies the presence, location, and type of one or more U.S. traffic signs in a given photograph using the LISA dataset â€” currently the largest known dataset of U.S. traffic signs with 47 different types of U.S. traffic signs.
* This group project involved exploratory data analysis (EDA), annotation preprocessing, memory reduction, parameter tuning, and training and testing a convolutional neural network-based object detection algorithm (YOLOv3) for maximum average precisions (AP) for each type of U.S. traffic sign, maximum intersection of union (IoU), and maximum mean average precision (mAP). Our final (best) results were a maximum IoU of 68% and a maximum mAP of 65%. Further work may be done in the future.
